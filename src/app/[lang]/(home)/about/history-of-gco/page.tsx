          Suitable objects are needed. There are various obstacles in the
          society. The evolution of time in the history of the world has created
          various social and environmental obstacles. Some become conscious and
          engage in awareness work while some are childish minds who are
          attracted to a subject. There is no chance to think about how many
          kinds of problems and crises there are in this vast world. But that
          child is not able to instill so much fear in his mind that, He is a
          child, solve so many things by him, Solutions are not worth thinking
          about. But the child’s mind is determined he will do something good
          for society, and he will stand beside the people of the society.

          <h2 className='font-bold'>FM Aid 2008-2014</h2>
          <p className='font-light text-sm mt-3 text-justify'>
            In 2008 we were an intermediate student. There is no limit to the
            thought that we will do many things. Let’s start realizing the
            problems of ordinary people. We think something should be done.
            Keeping these issues in mind, let me first discuss with the boys in
            my village, they are all very interested and later I got a good
            reassurance from my school friends. This discussion was officially
            made a reality on June 1, 2008. Everyone was able to agree that we
            will do something good. Money is needed to do anything else. What or
            who will be the source of this money? It was decided that we would
            pay a monthly contribution. Stands by the helpless people with this
            paid money ‍and will try to cooperate as much as possible. The
            decision was finalized and donations were collected as usual. Since
            we will not be able to accomplish this great work with this little
            money, So we started taking the help of some great people in our
            society. We continued our activities and Our organization was named
            FM Aid (Father Mother Aid). Among our social activities were,
            distribution of winter clothes, education scholarships to poor
            meritorious students, free medical campaign, providing assistance to
            river erosion victims, provide financial support to small business
            entrepreneurs. For further expansion of our social activities we
            thought our organization needed social integration that mean’s
            Government registration. Later we contacted the Upazila Social
            Service Office and Registration is provided by our Bangladesh
            Government Department of Social Services as per the instructions and
            conditions.

          <h2 className='font-bold'>Peace Foundation 2014-2018</h2>
          <p className='font-light text-sm mt-3 text-justify'>
            As we are thinking about this in a more comprehensive way, the name
            FMAID was changed to Peace Foundation in 2014 in a consensual order
            and in accordance with the guidelines of social services. After that
            the continuity of our social activities continues and continue to
            receive funding grants and conduct activities from the public,
            government, non-government level. We have been doing various good
            deeds in the society but we have not fixed any specific activities.
            When that seemed like a problem and we are doing what we have the
            opportunity to do. There is no specific plan. A few days later, that
            is, 2015-2016, some social obstacles during this period. The
            organization has survived until today, surrounded by those who
            completed their studies, everyone has fallen into a problem of what
            their own career will do, what will happen, in such a situation the
            organization spends a critical time and leadership is going to be
            zero. We are determined to overcome this crisis in any way we can
            ‍and turn around. The activities were started continuously again.
            But again and again a subject began to work in my head, all the
            responsibilities of society are what we some young people? Not just
            us. So go ahead with at least one issue, in other words, let’s solve
            at least one problem of society. The question of what the
            organization has been doing for so long may be common members and
            ordinary people, but we can say that we have done as much as we can,
            and at least we think for the helpless people of the society.

          <p className='text-sm font-light mt-3'>
            It was decided to change the name once again based on the opinion of
            the policy makers. A new horizon was started under the name of
            Global Community Organization. In this crisis, a general meeting was
            called as a matter of urgency. The election manifesto was published
            to take the organization forward with a new committee and a specific
            goal and the future master plan of the organization. We have strong
            morale and faith in our minds, some individual / member centric
            organizations cannot be abolished. A new project was announced with
            the conviction to turn around again. Which will bring a
            groundbreaking change around the world.
