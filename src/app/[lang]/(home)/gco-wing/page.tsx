            Making an impact isn't about one person taking one big action, it's
            about a community of like-minded people coming together and taking
            small actions every day. Tree Ambassadors are passionate
            environmental stewards who want to represent One Tree for One Child
            â€” and aren't afraid to get their hands in the dirt to make an impact
            at work, at home, or at school. Together, we are building a
            community of tree-lovers around the world who are doing their part,
            one tree at a time.
