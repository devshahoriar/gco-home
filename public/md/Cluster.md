5. **Resilience Building**: Enhance the ability of communities to withstand and adapt to climate change, natural disasters, and economic challenges.

**Core Components of the Cluster Village Program**

1. **Formation of Village Clusters:**
    - The program begins by identifying **clusters of neighboring villages** that share common challenges and opportunities.

    - **Village committees** or **community groups** are formed to lead the development activities and ensure community participation.
2. **Improved Agricultural Practices:**
    - The program focuses on promoting **sustainable agricultural practices** through training and resources. This includes introducing **organic farming**, **rainwater harvesting**, **crop diversification**, and **agroforestry** to enhance food security and income generation.
    - Farmers are trained in modern farming techniques that help improve **yield** and **reduce dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides**.
    - The program supports the creation of **community-managed farms** or **cooperatives**, where farmers can share tools, machinery, and resources to reduce costs and increase productivity.
3. **Water and Sanitation Infrastructure:**
    - To improve public health, the program helps establish **clean water sources** such as wells, **rainwater harvesting systems**, and **community filtration units**.
    - Sanitation improvements, including the construction of **latrines** and **waste management systems**, ensure that basic hygiene and health standards are met, reducing the prevalence of waterborne diseases.
    - **Community education** on the importance of hygiene and safe drinking water is integrated into the program to ensure that families can maintain health standards.
4. **Access to Healthcare:**
    - Mobile health clinics or **community health workers** are deployed to provide **basic healthcare services**, including **preventive care**, **vaccinations**, and **treatment for common illnesses**.
