**History of GCO**

The history of the **Global Community Organization (GCO)** reflects the determination of young minds to address social and environmental challenges despite numerous obstacles. Recognizing the vast problems in the world, the organization was born from the simple yet powerful resolve of a child-like mindset—to contribute positively to society. Driven by a desire to stand by the people and make a difference, GCO's founders turned their awareness into action, evolving over time to become a force for social and environmental change. Their journey highlights the power of determination and the willingness to serve, even in the face of daunting challenges.

In 2008, as intermediate students, we began recognizing the struggles of ordinary people and felt compelled to take action. Driven by the desire to make a difference, we initiated discussions within our village and later with school friends, all of whom supported the idea of helping society. On June 1, 2008, this idea was formally brought to life, and we agreed to contribute monthly to fund our activities. This small fund became the foundation for our mission to assist the helpless and address societal challenges.

### ****The Beginning of FM Aid (2008-2014)****

In 2008, as intermediate students, we began recognizing the struggles of ordinary people and felt compelled to take action. Driven by the desire to make a difference, we initiated discussions within our village and later with school friends, all of whom supported the idea of helping society. On June 1, 2008, this idea was formally brought to life, and we agreed to contribute monthly to fund our activities. This small fund became the foundation for our mission to assist the helpless and address societal challenges.

Our organization, named **FM Aid (Father Mother Aid)**, focused on helping those in need by undertaking various social welfare initiatives. These included distributing winter clothes, awarding scholarships to underprivileged yet meritorious students, organizing free medical campaigns, providing support to victims of river erosion, and offering financial assistance to small business entrepreneurs. While the funds raised through personal contributions were limited, we also sought the support of benevolent individuals in our community to expand our reach.

Recognizing the importance of sustainability and broader recognition, we decided to formalize our efforts by registering FM Aid with the government. After contacting the Upazila Social Service Office, our organization was officially registered under the **Bangladesh Government Department of Social Services**. This milestone allowed us to integrate into the wider social framework and continue our mission with legitimacy and enhanced capacity.

The initial phase of FM Aid was marked by enthusiasm, determination, and a strong commitment to standing by the helpless. It set the foundation for more structured and impactful efforts, addressing pressing community issues and fostering hope among vulnerable populations. Through collective action and the spirit of service, FM Aid became a beacon of support, proving that even modest beginnings can lead to meaningful change.

**Transition to Peace Foundation (2014-2018)**

In 2014, the organization **FM Aid** underwent a significant transformation. The name was changed to **Peace Foundation** to reflect a broader, more comprehensive vision for social welfare and to align with social service guidelines. This change marked a new chapter, but our core mission of serving the community remained the same. We continued to conduct various social activities and received funding and grants from public, government, and non-government sectors. Despite our commitment to doing good, our activities lacked a clear focus or specific plan. This made our efforts somewhat scattered and without a defined purpose.

In the period between 2015 and 2016, the organization faced several challenges. During this time, some internal obstacles arose as many of the founding members completed their studies and were uncertain about their future careers. This uncertainty led to a critical period for the Peace Foundation, where leadership became weak, and the organization struggled to maintain its momentum. The focus shifted from active service to contemplation about the future, and at one point, it seemed as if the foundation might cease to function.

However, our determination to continue overcoming these challenges kept the organization alive. We resolved to rebuild and re-establish our efforts to make a meaningful impact on society. After the crisis, activities resumed with renewed energy, but a question began to occupy my mind: **Can we, a small group of young people, solve the vast range of social problems on our own?** The realization dawned that while we were doing what we could, our efforts lacked a defined focus, which hindered their long-term effectiveness.

Rather than continuing to address random issues as they came up, we decided to dedicate ourselves to solving at least one specific social problem, one that we could focus on and work towards with clear objectives. This decision gave us a renewed sense of direction and purpose, marking a turning point in the organization’s approach.

By this point, we recognized that although our efforts may not have solved every issue, we had made a real difference in the lives of many. Despite the challenges and the uncertain leadership at times, the Peace Foundation stood as a symbol of hope for those in need. We may not have always known exactly what we were doing, but we knew we were trying to make the world a better place for the helpless members of society.

The experience of these years taught us the importance of having a focused mission and a clear strategy for addressing specific societal problems, which laid the groundwork for future initiatives and continued growth of the Peace Foundation.

### ****Global Community Organization (2019 - Present)****

In 2019, the **Global Community Organization (GCO)** embarked on a transformative journey, marking a significant shift in its operations and mission. Based on the advice of policymakers, the organization underwent a name change to reflect a broader, more inclusive vision. Amidst challenges, a general meeting was held to redefine the organization's path, with a new committee and a clear focus on achieving specific goals. The urgency of this change was driven by the desire to overcome difficulties and chart a course that would have a lasting impact on the community and the world.

With strong morale and commitment, GCO embraced a new project that would serve as its core initiative, aiming to create groundbreaking global change. This project, titled **"ONE TREE FOR ONE CHILD"** became the organization’s master plan, highlighting key objectives aimed at environmental sustainability and socio-economic development.
