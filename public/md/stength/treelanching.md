**Treelancing** is a revolutionary initiative i.e. earning money by gifting trees to children provided by organizations without investment. The objective of this initiative is a huge platform for youth especially students to earn without investment. The great initiative of a pioneer in environmental protection is to turn the social forestry program into a social movement by implementing the **One Tree for One Child** program and to be involved in making the **Global Community Organization's** goals of healthy, quality, improved livelihoods and sustainable environment a reality.

Here’s the rearranged process in a more standard flow:

**1\. TYAGI Volunteer Registration**

The first step is the registration of TYAGI Volunteers. Volunteers must complete online registration, following the prescribed rules and regulations set by the organization.

**2\. Approval**

Volunteers who apply after thoroughly reading and understanding all the conditions will be selected and given final approval to participate in the program.

**3\. Determining the Area of Work**

The working area for the Treelancing program should be clearly specified. This includes determining the Union, Municipality, Upazila, or City Corporation, including the relevant wards.

**4\. Monthly Tree Demand**

The number of trees to be distributed each month should be specified, particularly the number of children to be gifted with trees each month.

**5\. Work Plan**

The work should be carried out according to the plan laid down by the organization. If an alternative strategy is suggested, the organization will review and finalize it for implementation.

**6\. Details Collection of Trees**

The procedure for collecting trees should be clearly defined, whether the trees are to be collected from the organization or managed under the volunteer’s own resources.

**7\. Duration of Work**

The duration of the tree distribution activities must be specified, providing a clear timeframe for the entire project.

**8\. Work Report**

Work is done in four steps for tree distribution:

- **Step 1**: Survey the newborn baby and fill the prescribed child registration form through the organization’s app.
- **Step 2**: Ensure tree distribution and planting by going door-to-door to every newborn child.
- **Step 3**: Within 2 weeks of planting, upload a photo of the tree along with its location to the child’s registration ID.
- **Step 4**: After 6 months, submit a final report on the tree’s status (whether alive or dead). If the tree is dead, report the cause, and if there is a valid reason, the tree should be replanted. A new photo of the replanted tree should be uploaded to the child’s ID.

**9\. Evaluation**

Points will be assigned for each completed task, such as filling out information correctly, distributing trees, and collecting photos with location details. Volunteers will have an account on the GCO app where they can view their performance and updates. Payments for work will be made monthly or quarterly, depending on the arrangement.

This process ensures that the Treelancing program runs smoothly, with clear instructions and accountability for each volunteer involved.
